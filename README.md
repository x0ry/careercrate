# Job Board Aggregator

![Job Board Aggregator - table view with salary and ATS data](docs/screenshot-table.png)

Automated job board aggregating 1,000,000+ positions from 20,000+ companies across seven major ATS platforms. Updated daily via GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Multi-platform scraping**: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, BambooHR, iCIMs, Paylocity, and Workday APIs scraped in parallel using `concurrent.futures`
- **Progressive loading**: Chunked gzip data loaded via Web Workers for fast initial render
- **Advanced filtering**: Filter by title, company, location, ATS platform, experience level, and exclude keywords. Toggle remote-only, hide recruiter postings, or hide already-applied jobs
- **Job tier classification**: Automatic skill-level tagging (intern/entry/mid/senior) using weighted keyword scoring on job titles
- **Application tracking**: Mark jobs as saved, applied, or ignored with batch update support via localStorage
- **URL state sync**: Filter/sort/page state persisted in the URL for shareable/bookmarkable searches
- **Responsive design**: Desktop table view with card-based mobile layout
- **Automated pipeline**: Daily GitHub Actions workflow: fetch existing data → scrape → merge → push chunks to the data repo → create release
- **Trend tracking + anomaly detection**: Daily per-platform counts are appended to a trend log; a check flags any platform whose volume deviates sharply from its recent baseline and opens a GitHub issue
- **Interactive heatmap**: Map view showing job density by location

# Chunked job data (jobs_chunk_*.json.gz + jobs_manifest.json) is NOT in this repo.
# Each run force-pushes it to a separate data repo (x0ry/job-board-data),
# which serves the chunks over its own GitHub Pages site.
# This keeps the code repo small and code-only while the data repo stays flat
# (force-pushed each run, so it never accumulates history).
```

## Data Pipeline

1. **Scrape**: `scraper.py` fetches jobs from all seven ATS APIs concurrently. Worker counts are tuned per platform to respect each one's rate limits: 50 for Workday, 30 for Greenhouse/Lever/iCIMs, 10 for BambooHR, and 5 for Ashby/Paylocity (the tightest limiters).
2. **Classify**: Each job is tagged with a skill level based on title keywords and flagged if posted by a recruiting agency
3. **Clean**: Jobs missing titles, URLs, or company info are dropped
4. **Chunk**: Results are split into ~25k-job gzipped chunks with a manifest file
5. **Merge**: `merge_data.py` deduplicates against existing data and prunes jobs older than 30 days
6. **Monitor**: A daily trend snapshot (per-platform and per-tier counts) is appended to `data/trends/daily.jsonl` and committed to main. `check_anomalies.py` compares each platform against its recent baseline and opens an issue if one drops off or spikes abnormally.
7. **Deploy**: GitHub Actions force-pushes the regenerated chunks to the separate `job-board-data` [repo](https://github.com/x0ry/job-board-data) and creates a tagged release on main. The frontend fetches chunks from the data repo's GitHub Pages site, keeping the main repo code-only.

## Company Discovery

Company lists are built from Common Crawl index data using a separate harvesting pipeline. The harvester scans CDX archives for URLs matching 20+ ATS domain patterns, extracts company slugs via regex, and deduplicates across multiple crawl snapshots. This currently yields give or take 95,000 unique company identifiers.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/x0ry/careercrate.git
cd careercrate
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

The frontend fetches live chunk data from the data repo's Pages site over the network, so local development works against current data without needing the chunks checked out locally.

To run the scraper locally:

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scraper.py --source manual
```
